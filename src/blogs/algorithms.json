They form the foundation for solving computational problems efficiently.\n\n## What are Data Structures?\n\nData structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing data. Some common data structures include:\n\n- Arrays\n- Linked Lists\n- Stacks\n- Queues\n- Trees\n- Graphs\n- Hash Tables\n\n## Array vs. Linked List\n\nUnderstanding the differences between arrays and linked lists is fundamental:\n\n| Feature | Array | Linked List |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Memory allocation | Contiguous | Non-contiguous |\n| Size | Fixed (in most languages) | Dynamic |\n| Element access | O(1) - Constant time | O(n) - Linear time |\n| Insertion/Deletion | O(n) - Linear time | O(1) - Constant time |\n| Memory usage | Less overhead | More overhead (pointers) |\n\n## Common Algorithms\n\n### Sorting Algorithms\n\nSorting algorithms arrange data in a certain order, most commonly in numerical or lexicographical order.\n\n- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n  - Time Complexity: O(n²)\n  - Space Complexity: O(1)\n\n- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around the pivot.\n  - Time Complexity: O(n log n) average case, O(n²) worst case\n  - Space Complexity: O(log n)\n\n- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\n  - Time Complexity: O(n log n)\n  - Space Complexity: O(n)\n\n### Search Algorithms\n\nSearch algorithms help find specific items in a data structure.\n\n- **Linear Search**: Checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.\n  - Time Complexity: O(n)\n\n- **Binary Search**: Works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n  - Time Complexity: O(log n)\n  - Requirement: ___Sorted data___\n\n## Recursion vs. Iteration\n\nRecursion and iteration are two different approaches to solving problems:\n\n[x] Recursion uses a function that calls itself\n[x] Iteration uses loops to repeat a process\n[ ] Recursion is always more efficient than iteration\n[ ] Iteration always uses less memory than recursion\n\n## Graph Algorithms\n\nGraphs represent networks of connected objects and have many practical applications:\n\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\n- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n\n![Graph Visualization](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31)\n\n## Complexity Analysis\n\nWe analyze algorithms using **Big O notation** which describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of:\n\n- Time complexity: How runtime grows relative to input size\n- Space complexity: How memory usage grows relative to input size\n\nCommon complexities from most to least efficient:\n- O(1) - Constant time\n- O(log n) - Logarithmic time\n- O(n) - Linear time\n- O(n log n) - Log-linear time\n- O(n²) - Quadratic time\n- O(2^n) - Exponential time",
